       <center><h2>A Tiny Bit of Math History</h2></center>
        <ul>
            <li>The Four Color Theorem: The first math theorem to be proven with modern day computers. While there were bits and 
                pieces of this theorem solved throughout its history, it took over 150 years for a complete proof to be provided.
            </li>
            <li>Fermat's Last Theorem: First stated in 1637 by Pierre Fermat, it was not proven until 1994 by  Andrew Wiles!</li>
            <li>Euclid's Parallel Postulate: This is one of five foundational pieces that make up our high school geometry. 
                Euclid stating this as a postulate meant that he did not provide a proof for it. 
                He just said it was true, accepted it as true, and built his geometry book based on it. 
                However, other mathematicians believed the Fifth Postulate had to be proven. For nearly 
                two millenia, people tried to prove the Parallel Postulate and failed. Nonetheless, their 
                endevours were not fruitless, as in the 1800's it lead to the studies of non-Euclidean geometry, 
                which has allowed us to understand how our universe works!
            </li>
            <li>The Pythagorean Brotherhood: Hopefully all of us who have gone through an American high school, math
                education have heard of the Pythagorean Theorem! Well, this same Pythagoras help lead what we might 
                today call a...ummm...cult. A math cult.
